-- 7.6 - Think About It: Why does LAST_VALUE() require RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED 
-- FOLLOWING to return the actual last value in the partition, 
-- while FIRST_VALUE() works correctly with the default frame? 
-- What is the default window frame when ORDER BY is specified, and how does that explain the behavior?
The default window frame with ORDER BY is:
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
FIRST_VALUE() works because the first row is always included in this frame.
LAST_VALUE() does not return the partition’s true last value because the frame ends at the current row. 

To include the entire partition, use:
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

This allows LAST_VALUE() to see and return the actual last value of the partition.
