-- 6.6 — Think About It: A CTE is defined once but referenced twice in the same outer query. 
-- A colleague says "CTEs are faster than subqueries because the database computes 
-- the result once and reuses it." Is this claim accurate? 
-- What would you need to do if you genuinely needed the result computed only once and reused?
No. A CTE is not guaranteed to be computed once and reused. It may be re-evaluated each time it is referenced.
If you need the result computed once and reused, materialize it, typically using a temporary table 
(#temp) (or a table variable for appropriate smaller workloads).
